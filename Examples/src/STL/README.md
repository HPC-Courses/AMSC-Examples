#Some utilities of the standard library#

Some code examples in this directory are modified version of those in
*The C++ Standard Library - A Tutorial and Reference, 2nd Edition"
by Nicolai M. Josuttis, Addison-Wesley, 2012*

Some updates have been made to introduce some C++17 goodies

* `cont/` examples on the use of different containers 

* `Set/`  use of sets with different comparison operators

* `Sort/` Use comparison operators to change sorting criteria.

* `Reduce/` Two new stl parallel algorithms

* `Map` A simple program that shows the main functionalities of `std::map`


#What do I lean here?#

- A few standard algorithms, of the many;
- The use of different comparison operators for ordered containers (an example of the Strategy design pattern).
